= Welcome to Trac 1.0.13 ( All Batteries Included )

Trac is a '''minimalistic''' approach to '''web-based''' management of
'''software projects'''. Its goal is to simplify effective tracking and handling of software issues, enhancements and overall progress.

All aspects of Trac have been designed with the single goal to
'''help developers write great software''' while '''staying out of the way'''
and imposing as little as possible on a team's established process and
culture.

As all Wiki pages, this page is editable, this means that you can
modify the contents of this page simply by using your
web-browser. Simply click on the "Edit this page" link at the bottom
of the page. WikiFormatting will give you a detailed description of
available Wiki formatting commands.

"[wiki:TracAdmin trac-admin] ''yourenvdir'' initenv" created
a new Trac environment, containing a default set of wiki pages and some sample
data. This newly created environment also contains
[wiki:TracGuide documentation] to help you get started with your project.

You can use [wiki:TracAdmin trac-admin] to configure
[http://trac.edgewall.org/ Trac] to better fit your project, especially in
regard to ''components'', ''versions'' and ''milestones''.


TracGuide is a good place to start.

Enjoy! [[BR]]

== All Batteries Included !!

Installing trac is straight forward, yes, but setting it up with all of the plugins I'd like to have takes a while ... versions, dependencies, etc ...

That's why I decided to create a Docker container in order to deploy with '''One Click''' a trac with every thing I want.

This trac contains some very cool stuff already:

* It is already served by apache2 over a secure SSL connection.
* [[http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/CodeExampleMacro|CodeExampleMacro]], which allows to add collapsible code blocks in a very cool way, either typing the code or referencing a file from one repository.
* GitHubSyncPlugin 0.1.4, for syncing GitHub repositories with local repositories ... cool
* [[https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/GraphvizPlugin|GraphvizPlugin]] To insert nice Graphivz diagrams
* [[https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/PlantUmlMacro|PlantUmlMacro]] ... Do you love UML diagrams ? With this plugin you can insert amazing UML diagrams in your wikis/blogs
* [[http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/PrivateWikiPlugin|PrivateWikiPlugin]] Allows you to have private wikis. Very handy if you want to have your very own and private stuff
* [[http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/SensitiveTicketsPlugin|SensitiveTicketsPlugin]] Allows the creation of sensitive tickets that only some people can look at
* [[http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/SimpleMultiProjectPlugin|SimpleMultiprojectPlugin]] Makes extremely easy to manage different projects
* [[http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/AccountManagerPlugin|AccountManagerPlugin]] Well ... this one is mandatory as default users management simply sucks ...
* [[http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/FullBlogPlugin|FullBlogPlugin]] May be it is not as beautiful as wordpress, but it makes really easy to write posts including code, specially if you include the code directly from a repository
* [[http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/IncludeMacro|IncludeMacro]] Another nice plugin to include different things in a wiki or blog
* [[http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/NewsFlashMacro|NewsFlashMacro]] Shows a window with whatever you want ... similar to #!box
* TracPdfPreview 0.1.2, allows the preview of a pdf without the need of download it. Nice.
* [[https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/ThemeEnginePlugin|ThemeEnginePlugin]] Yes, default trac aspect looks a little bit old. This plugin allows the use of different themes. 
* [[http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/TracpathTheme|TracpathTheme]] this plugin includes some alternative themes.
* [[http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/TocMacro|TocMacro]] Almost a must ... with it you can add table of contents to your pages.
* [[http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/WikiExtrasPlugin|WikiExtrasPlugin]] Adds a lot of nice features. Check out the documentation. It is worth it !
* [[http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/TracWysiwygPlugin|TracWysiwygPlugin]] Makes the edition a little bit more comfortable.
* TseveTheme 1.0, just another cool theme. The one I'm using at https://room1408.tk
* WikiAutoComplete 1.0, offers some autocompletion when you are typing.
* [[http://www.awstats.org|Awstats]] !! This docker includes awstats statistics out of the box.

And all of this just deploying this container !! 

Enjoy !!
